Right now, that includes representing 3D CAD models as programs and developing synthesis-based tools for *bidirectional editing*, *constraint exploration*, and *design optimization*. I am always looking for new applications for this work, particularly in the domain of improving architecture, design, and the built environment.",

I completed my undergraduate degree as a dual major in both *Architecture* and *Computer Science*, and I'm still working to intersect them -- if you're interested in combining these fields, please do reach out!"

At its core, it provides a reimplementation of standard components to run in parallel as a drop-in replacement to the Grasshopper standard library. Impala is excellent for processing *point clouds*, *landscape data*, and *physical simulations*.",

    t / "Drop-in replacement of existing components with Impala variants yielded *speedups of 10-20x* relative to the base Grasshopper implementation on a mix of standard and randomly-generated workloads. More speedup is achieved in adversarial cases, or where several Impala components can be chained together. Additionally, using Impala can significantly reduce the memory overhead of a Grasshopper script, resulting in smoother overall interactivity."

For a detailed description of the semantics of these primitives, the interested reader can refer to the $report.",
      t / s"Together these allow the user to precisely convey their intent for what should be parallelized. Our compiler then analyzes nested and consecutive parallel-fors and lowers them to $cuda, performing loop fusion and merging nested parallelism in attempting to minimize the number of launches needed. $dag We demonstrate the efficacy of our system through concise and performant programs performing large matrix multiplications, fractal renderings (seen above), and previous 15-418 course assignments -- all problems that are embarassingly parallel, but somewhat painful to implement. We theorize that this approach would work reasonably well with other parallel GPU backends."

After the initial design is set, further work exports the geometry and parameters to a higher-detail format for processing in Autodesk Revit.",
