It works as a directed graph of components, each performing an operation, that send trees of data along edges to trigger recomputation.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.food4rhino.com/app/impala" target="_blank">Impala</a> dramatically improves the performance of Grasshopper on models that handle large amounts of data. At its core, it provides a reimplementation of standard components to run in parallel as a drop-in replacement to the Grasshopper standard library. Impala is excellent for processing <em>point clouds</em>, <em>landscape data</em>, and <em>physical simulations</em>.<br/><br/>Impala combines this strategy with a few key insights to maximize the available performance benefit:<ul><li><em>Minimize allocation overhead.</em> Impala re-implements the basic data tree structure. This allows space to be preallocated, trees to be filled in parallel, and a compact encoding of tree paths.</li><li><em>Restrict type-casts.</em> Impala assumes a homogenous type of data in a tree, as is nearly always the case in practice. This allows type conversions to happen much more quickly for large data trees.</li><li><em>Algorithmic optimization.</em> Impala replaces some quadratic implementations in the standard library with custom strategies that have improved parallel complexity.</li></ul>Drop-in replacement of existing components with Impala variants yielded <em>speedups of 10-20x</em> relative to the base Grasshopper implementation on a mix of standard and randomly-generated workloads. More speedup is achieved in adversarial cases, or where several Impala components can be chained together. Additionally, using Impala can significantly reduce the memory overhead of a Grasshopper script, resulting in smoother overall interactivity.</div></div></div><div class="project-wrapper" onclick="expand(event)"><div class="project-title">DAG</div><div class="project-content expand"><div class="subtitle"><p>Data-parallel programming language compiled for GPU.</p><div class="arrow expand"></div></div><div class="project-details expand" onclick="swallow(event)"><hr/><img src="images/julia_render.png"></img><br/><br/>As part of CMU's <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~418/" target="_blank">15-418</a>, Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-roberts-135238139/" target="_blank">Nick Roberts</a> and I designed an implemented a programming language to easily prototype different strategies for parallelisation on the GPU.<br/><br/>Our basic concept is to represent each program point as an expression node in directed acyclic graph. This directly expresses which nodes contain dependencies. We derive a traversal of this DAG representing a particular parallel execution, and optimize our choices based on statically gathered heuristics such as minimizing memory transfer.<br/><br/>We directly model regular parallelism inherent in the program as a set of first-class primitive parallel-expressions, which include <code>for</code>, <code>zip_with</code>, <code>filter_with</code>,<code>reduce</code>, <code>scan</code>, <code>range</code>, and <code>transpose</code>. For a detailed description of the semantics of these primitives, the interested reader can refer to the <a href="https://nick-and-dan.github.io/418/files/report.pdf" target="_blank">full report</a>.<br/><br/>Together these allow the user to precisely convey their intent for what should be parallelized. Our compiler then analyzes nested and consecutive parallel-fors and lowers them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" target="_blank">CUDA kernel launches</a>, performing loop fusion and merging nested parallelism in attempting to minimize the number of launches needed. <br/><img src="images/dag_structure.png"></img><figcaption>Compiler Structure.</figcaption><br/> We demonstrate the efficacy of our system through concise and performant programs performing large matrix multiplications, fractal renderings (seen above), and previous 15-418 course assignments &mdash; all problems that are embarassingly parallel, but somewhat painful to implement. We theorize that this approach would work reasonably well with other parallel GPU backends.</div></div></div><div class="project-wrapper" onclick="expand(event)"><div class="project-title">Modeling Tools</div><div class="project-content expand"><div class="subtitle"><p>Constraint-Based Modeling: Panel Designer & Fa√ßade Painter</p><div class="arrow expand"></div></div><div class="project-details expand" onclick="swallow(event)"><hr/>Under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-holland-683ab76a" target="_blank">Nate Holland</a><br/><br/><img src="images/facade-painter-iso-hires.png"></img><figcaption>Rendered view of full-resolution geometry generated by the Facade Painter</figcaption><br/><br/>In design computation team at <a href="http://www.nbbj.com/" target="_blank">NBBJ</a>, we worked on solutions to aid the design and modeling process of building facades, which are often complex and unwieldy to manipulate and iterate on in existing building information modeling pipelines. Our solution allowed users to model a module or a set of pattern modules responsively with constraints in Rhino3D and pattern them adaptively and parameterically using Grasshopper3D. After the initial design is set, further work exports the geometry and parameters to a higher-detail format for processing in Autodesk Revit.<br/><br/><img src="images/facade-toolkit-3.png"></img><figcaption>Prototype user interface</figcaption><br/><br/>In this work, the designer is able to quickly insert and remove constraints, and constraints are responsive and flexible to user editing.
